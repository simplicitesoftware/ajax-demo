Ajax web frontend demo
======================

This project is a **very basic** web front-end demo written in a single HTML page (including jQuery&reg;) using the Simplicit&eacute;&reg; REST services.

If you want to use your own Simplicit&eacute;&reg; instance you just need to adjust the root URL in the `root` variable to point to your instance's base API URL (typically `http[s]://<my host>/[<mycontextroot>]/api`)
